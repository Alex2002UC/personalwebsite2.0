## Traveling

I Love to travel and explore new places! I have been lucky enough to grow up in a family that also enjoys exploring, whether it be regional cities or far away countries. It is still my dream to have a job that gives me the opportunity to travel a couple weeks out of the year. Some of the places I've been include the Bahamas, Mexico, New York, and Florida.

## Pets

I am a dog lover, and I will continue to be one for the rest of my life. When I was younger I grew up with two brother Lhasa Ahpsos that were small but mighty. I love how dogs have combine loyalty and constant love, in a way that truly makes them life companions. I currently have a young 4 year old Springer Spaniel named Traviesa, otherwise known as Naughty in english. I love to spend time with her on walks or playing her favorite pass time: fetch.

## Hometown

I am a southern Californian at heart, and I grew up in a suburban town called West Covina, or what I like to call-The best Covina. West Covina is a city in Los Angeles county that has a population of about 109,000. West Covina is famous for being the shooting location of the show "Crazy Ex-Girlfriend", and the movie "Good Burger".
