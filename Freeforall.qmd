## I Love to Eat Different Cuisines

As a Mexican American and someone who grew up in LA county, Mexican food is simply a part of my daily consumption. For me, the spices and flavors of Mexican food can never be replaced, as the taste provides me with an essence of home.However, being in LA county there are so many other cultures that are strongly present, that I joyfully will go on little micro-adventures to explore new foods. Recently, I've made it my mission to explore more resturaunts here in Santa Barbara while I still can.
