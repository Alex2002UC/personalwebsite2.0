This report was created originally during Fall quarter of 2024, at UCSB, for ENVS 116: Communities and Environmental Justice. I was inspired by my Hometown, West Covina, because coyotes are a daily occurrence. I never realized how many people viewed coyotes as pests or labelled them solely as dangerous. So, I wanted to explore how wildlife are treated around the US, and explore potential solutions.
