It is still my dream to have a job that gives me the opportunity to travel a couple weeks out of the year. Some of the places I’ve been include the Bahamas, Mexico, New York, and Florida."

I love how dogs have combine loyalty and constant love, in a way that truly makes them life companions. I currently have a young 4 year old Springer Spaniel named Traviesa, otherwise known as Naughty in english. I love to spend time with her on walks or playing her favorite pass time: fetch."
