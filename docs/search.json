It is still my dream to have a job that gives me the opportunity to travel a couple weeks out of the year. Some of the places I’ve been include the Bahamas, Mexico, New York, and Florida."

I love how dogs have combine loyalty and constant love, in a way that truly makes them life companions. I currently have a young 4 year old Springer Spaniel named Traviesa, otherwise known as Naughty in english. I love to spend time with her on walks or playing her favorite pass time: fetch."

    "text": "As a Mexican American and someone who grew up in LA county, Mexican food is simply a part of my daily consumption. For me, the spices and flavors of Mexican food can never be replaced, as the taste provides me with an essence of home.However, being in LA county there are so many other cultures that are strongly present, that I joyfully will go on little micro-adventures to explore new foods. Recently, I’ve made it my mission to explore more resturaunts here in Santa Barbara while I still can.\n\n\n\nSukiyaki — A comforting Japanese hot pot soup that features salty sweet broth with meat, mushrooms, and Tofu. I ate this dish at Uniboil, in Goleta, CA. .\n\n\n\n\n\nSouthern Chinese Food — I tried a new place in Santa Barbara called the Mandarin Palace. Here we ate Spicy noodles, pan fried bao, Beef Chow Fun, and Three treasures dishes. Super tasty and I learned more about Southern Chinese cuisine.\n\n\n\n\n\nKorean Food — I love going out with my family, and this timw we tried BCD tofu House in Koreatown, downtown LA. My favorites were the Bimbipap and Korean Seafood pancake.\n\n\n\n\n\nChinese Food — This is the resturaunt “Thumbling”, located in West Covina. This is a staple in my family’s rotation whenever we plan to eat out. We love to order the garlic Bok Choy, fried rice, chinese fried rice cooks, and soup dumplings.\n\n\n\n\n\nTacos — A traditional Mexican dish that everyone in California has eaten at least once. These specific tacos were eaten in San Diego during a friend trip, sadly I don’t remember the specific place.\n\n\n\n\n\nChorizo — This is a dish that my mother will cook on very special occasions. Chorizo is seasoned pork sausage that we combine with a cubed potatoe to create a hearty savory dish."
