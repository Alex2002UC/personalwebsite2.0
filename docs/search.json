    "text": "Environmentalists work in many sectors, and are employed in a variety of roles that require different skill sets. Therefore, as an environmental science student, it is critical to equip myself for the future and the job market by developing new skills. ENVS 193DS did exactly that.\nThe class built my foundation in coding in R, equiping me with the confidence to go one and fo my own personal project. This specific personal project was fostered by my curiosity: Do I on average spend more time cooking on school days or non school days?\nThroughout spring quarter I created a dataset that recorded by time spent cooking every day, and towards the end of the quarter I inputted it into R to determine the answer to my question.\nBefore you read on, let it be known that my assumption when I developed this question, was that I would spend more time cooking during the weekends that on school days. On school days I have classes and I tend to work on assighnments more, so I assumed that I would spend less time cooking. In the rest of this blog I lay out the code I ran to determine weither my assumption was correct or not."

In the future, hopefully when I have more time, I hope that the time I spend cooking will only increase as I advance further into my cooking journey. I didn’t realize how large of an impact wanting to be lazy on the weekends, led to me eating leftovers and eating out more, rather than wantng to cook more at home."
